// SM:RPG Damage+ Upgrade Config
//
// This config can be used to change the additional damage done per weapon.
// If a weapon isn't listed here or has one of the options missing, 
// the plugin uses the default values from the 
// convars smrpg_damage_percent and smrpg_damage_max.
//
// All weapons get the default damage boost set by the above convars by default.
// If you want to exclude a weapon from this upgrade, 
// just set "dmg_increase" to "0" for that weapon.
//
// Use the weapon's entity name as the section name.
// There are two options to set for each weapon:
// - "dmg_increase"       : Percentage of damage done the victim loses additionally (multiplied by level).
//                          When set to e.g. "0.05", the victim receives 5% of the damage done additionally.
//                          If you hit an enemy with 50 damage, this upgrade would add 50 * 0.05 = 2,5 damage on level 1,
//                          50 * 0.1 = 5 damage on level 2, ... 
// - "max_additional_dmg" : Maximum damage a player could deal additionally ignoring higher percentual values. (0 = disable)
//                          When this is set to e.g. "10" and you have "dmg_increase" set to "0.1", a hit with 50 damage
//                          at upgrade level 3 would normally add 50 * 0.3 = 15 damage, but this option caps it at 10 damage.
//
// Here's an example section:
// "weapon_awp"
// {
//     "dmg_increase" "0.03"
//     "max_additional_dmg" "20"
// }
"DamagePlusWeapons"
{
//	"weapon_deagle"
//	{
//		"dmg_increase" "0.05"
//		"max_additional_dmg" "35"
//	}
